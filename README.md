## SPE_Speech_Evaluator using DevOps CI/CD Pipeline

Developed as part of SPE course team project

A Django web application which analyzes spoken English for basic interview questions and provides 
feedback based on syntax analysis (grammatical correctness), vocabulary-strength of the user, which 
will also indicate the relevance of the answer relative to question asked. In effect it acts like a 
AI based Mock Interview performance analyzer.

Entire development process is done using DevOps CI/CD Pipeline approach. We carry-out version control
of source-code, testing, build/dependency installations/environment setup, containerization, deployment,
logging and monitoring using various DevOps tools. The tools which we used in this project are Git, 
Django-test-framework, python-logger, Jenkins, Docker, Rundeck and ELK + Filebeat Stack.
